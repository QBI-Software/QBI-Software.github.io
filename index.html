    <h1>QBI Software</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the QBI Software site!</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Applications</h3>
      <p>Custom software applications can be developed for QBI research teams to assist with analysis or data management.</p>
      <p>Examples so far include applications in Matlab, Python and Django, as well as NEURON models.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Scripts</h3>
      <p>Repetitive analysis of data can often be automated using macros or scripts, especially for image analysis in Fiji/ImageJ or Excel sheet data in python or R.</p>
      <p>Useful scripts are added to the QBI-Software github repository so others may benefit.  If you have a good script you'd like to share please contact me below.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Training</h3>        
      <p>Introductory training courses will be available for all staff and students at QBI covering basic computing skills such as using the Unix shell as well as user-friendly training for Python and R.</p>
      <p>Requests for training in specific languages or technologies are welcome.</p>
