<p>A recent addition to QBI services is the capability to develop and manage custom software applications, macros, plugins, scripts or just provide assistance and advice on software matters for all staff and students at QBI free of charge.</p>

<h3>
<a id="applications" class="anchor" href="#applications" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Applications</h3>

<p>Custom software applications can be developed for QBI research teams to assist with analysis or data management.
Examples so far include applications for neurite analysis in Matlab, particle tracking in Python and a frog database in Django.</p>

<h3>

<p>Data and image analysis often requires several steps in preparing the data or image, extraction of features and finally, production of output data for further analysis.  , as well as NEURON models
Automation into a bulk operation can drastically reduce analysis time from weeks to minutes.  Maybe you need full custom development or just assistance with plugins, macros or scripts in Python, Matlab or R. 
Integration with Fiji/ImageJ, Matlab or other open source software packages is also supported as is parsing Excel or CSV data in Python or R.</p>

<h3>
<a id="training" class="anchor" href="#training" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Training</h3>

<p>Introductory training courses are available covering basic computing skills such as using the Unix shell as well as user-friendly training for Python and R.
Requests for training in specific languages or technologies are welcome.</p>
